<h1>Mediator</h1>

<p>
	The Mediator pattern provides a technique for handling complicated 
	communication logic between several objects.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine you have a number of objects that need to interact with each other. 
	When one of your objects is changed then it, in turn, needs to call some 
	functions on some of the other objects. When those objects are changed, 
	they may need to call functions on yet further objects.
</p>

<p>
	This is an example of complicated object communication, where each object 
	needs to know about several other objects.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The Mediator pattern suggests we move any logic relating to how the objects communicate 
	into a new separate object. So rather than having the communication logic spread throughout 
	all of the individual objects, we instead have one object that knows how all of this communication 
	should be organised. All of our individual objects now only communicate with this new central object 
	rather than with each other.
</p>

<p>
	This new central object is our <b>Mediator</b>.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	In the Mediator pattern the objects the Mediator communicates with are referred to as <b>Colleagues</b>.
</p>

<p>
	Let's work through an example of how the Mediator pattern might be applied.
</p>

<h2>Example: Encapsulating complicated logic</h2>

<p>
	Suppose we have a set of objects A, B, C and D that may be started or stopped. 
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='An object that can start and stop' src='assets/images/046B66F03B8DDD35C277FECA7272FD27.png' />
</p>

<p>
	They have some rules of operation such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>if A is stopped then B and C must be started,</li>
<li>if B is stopped then C and D must be started,</li>
<li>if C is stopped then D and A must be started,</li>
<li>if D is stopped then A and B must be started.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This set of communication is a little complicated to manage. 
	Without a Mediator the communication logic would be embedded within the objects themselves.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Complicated communication logic' src='assets/images/1CE53C825E8DCD5C5D363AFF96A249A8.png' />
</p>

<p>
	An implementation of object A without a Mediator might be something like this.
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
component {

    variables.b = 0
    variables.c = 0

    // Function to partner objects together
    function partnerWith(b,c) {
        variables.b = b;
        variables.c = c;
    }

    function stop() {
        b.start();
        c.start();
    }

    function start() {
        // Do something
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}







<p>
	We can see that object A is directly partnered with (i.e. coupled with) Object B and Object C
</p>

<p>
	To simplify these objects and to reduce their coupling with each other, let's introduce our <b>Mediator</b>.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Mediator' src='assets/images/E195B6FF7EF5F0CD04E20A143732FA86.png' />
</p>

<p>
	Whenever one of our colleague objects is stopped it needs to tell the Mediator that this has occurred. In this example, our objects A, B , C and D will call the <b>stopping()</b> function on the Mediator when they are stopped. 
</p>

<p>
	Now our objects only communicate with the Mediator rather than with each other. This means that our objects are only coupled with the Mediator, rather that with multiple colleagues.
</p>

<p>
	<img title='Mediator' src='assets/images/4F3C651788756280843666C2836AD29E.png' />
</p>

<p>
	Our object A may now look something like this:
</p>





{% highlight cfm %}
component {

    variables.mediator = 0;

    // Function to tell the object about the mediator
    function setMediator(mediator) {
        variables.mediator = mediator;
    }

    // Function to return the objects unique id
    function id() {
        return 'A'
    }

    function stop() {
        mediator.stopping(this);
    }

    function start() {
        // Do something
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}







<p>
	When <b>stop()</b> is called on object A, it just notifies the Mediator 
	that it is stopping, passing itself as the parameter.
</p>

<p>
	Our Mediator now handles the communication logic that deals with the other 
	objects via the <b>stopping()</b> function.
</p>





{% highlight cfm %}
component {

    // The mediator needs to know about all of the objects
    variables.a = 0;
    variables.b = 0;
    variables.c = 0;
    variables.d = 0;

    // Function to tell the mediator about all of the objects.
    function setColleagues(a,b,c,d) {
        variables.a = a;
        variables.b = b;
        variables.c = c;
        variables.d = d;
    }

    // All communication logic is now held within our mediator
    function stopping(object) {
        if (object.id() == 'A') {
            b.start();
            c.start();
        }
        else if (object.id() == 'B') {
            c.start();
            d.start();
        }
        else if (object.id() == 'C') {
            d.start();
            a.start();
        }
        else if (object.id() == 'D') {
            a.start();
            b.start();
        }
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}







<h2>Colleague to Mediator communication</h2>

<p>
	As you've see in this example, the colleague objects need to pass messages 
	to the mediator which, in turn, forward messages onto other colleagues.
</p>

<p>
	In some situations, as in this example, the colleagues have direct knowledge 
	of the mediator object and call whatever methods are required.
</p>

<p>
	An alternative to this is to implement the colleague to mediator communication 
	using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern">Observer pattern</a>, 
	which reduces the coupling between your colleague objects and your mediator.
