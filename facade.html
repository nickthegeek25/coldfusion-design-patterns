<h1>Facade</h1>

<p>
	A Facade is an object that provides a simplified view of a more complex underlying system, 
	which effectively makes the underlying system easier to use.
</p>

<p>
	In the following diagram, we have a Facade object which understands the complexities 
	of a number of objects beyond. The Client objects make use of the Facade which makes 
	their code significantly easier to write and understand.
</p>

<h2>Example: Technology room</h2>

<p>
	A simple example may be represented by a room specifically designed for teaching technology students. 
	This room may have some audio visual equipment as well as a number of computers for the students to use. 
	When a teacher comes into the room they need to turn on all of the equipment to prepare the room for the lesson. 
	This might involve:
</p>

<ul>
<li>turning on the lights</li>
<li>turning on the projector</li>
<li>turning on the audio system</li>
<li>turning on each of the computers</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We may need to follow the reverse set of steps when we are finished using the room.
</p>

<p>
	The objects in our technology room may look something like this:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Technology room UML objects' src='assets/images/0DA567BDD1092F57BB8424E8165A5F30.png' />
</p>

<p>
	In reality each of these pieces of equipment is generally simple to use, 
	but they each have their own different way of being operated and you need 
	to know the specific details of each.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally it would be nice if we could simply flick a switch and everything in the room comes 
	to life without you needing to manually operate each individual piece of equipment. 
	This would simplify the operation of the room, and would event allow a non technical person 
	to prepare the room (such as one of the students).
</p>

<p>
	Let's create a Facade called a TechnologyRoom which simplifies the start up and shut down of all of the room's equipment.
</p>

<p>
	<img title='Technology room UML diagram' src='assets/images/3AD91DBEE2CFD74E89AEE552FD06F7FB.png' />
</p>

<p>
	Our TechnologyRoom startUp() function turns on all of the equipment in the room:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="startUp" output="false">
    <cfset room.lightsOn()>
    <cfset projector.on()>
    <cfset audioSystem.on()>
    <cfset computerNetwork.startUp()>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}



<p>
	And the shutDown() function might perform similar steps to turn off all of the rooms equipment:
</p>






{% highlight cfm %}
<cffunction name="shutDown" output="false">
    <cfset computerNetwork.shutDown()>
    <cfset audioSystem.off()>
    <cfset projector.off()>
    <cfset room.lightsOff()>
</cffunction>
{% endhighlight %}




<p>
	So here we have a single object called TechnologyRoom with two functions; startUp() and shutDown(). 
	This object is trivial to use and requires no knowledge of the lighting system, projector, audio system 
	or the computers. Our Technology Room Facade has greatly simplified our usage of the room.
</p>

<p>
	You may notice that we also have a ComputerNetwork object, which is in fact another Facade to the network of computers.
</p>


<h2>Example: New member registration process</h2>

<p>
	Many applications have a registration process to gain membership. 
	As part of a successful registration process we may need to complete 
	a series of steps such as saving the registration details, 
	processing a payment and sending a welcome email. In a well designed 
	system each of these operations would be in different objects.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Member Service UML diagram' src='assets/images/2A726107F3C71EB93C8F5BAF63241ABB.png' />
</p>

<p>
	In this example, the Member Service is our Facade. Let's take a look at how it may be implemented.
</p>








{% highlight cfm %}
<cfcomponent name="MemberService" output="false">

    <!--- PRIVATE VARIABLES --->

    <cfset variables.memberGateway = 0>
    <cfset variables.paymentService = 0>
    <cfset variables.notificationService = 0>

    <!--- INITIALISATION --->

    <cffunction name="init" output="false">
        <cfargument name="memberGateway" required="true">
        <cfargument name="paymentService" required="true">
        <cfargument name="notificationService" required="true">
        <cfset variables.memberGateway = arguments.memberGateway>
        <cfset variables.paymentService = arguments.paymentService>
        <cfset variables.notificationService = arguments.notificationService>
    </cffunction>

    <!--- PUBLIC FUNCTIONS --->

    <cffunction name="newMember" output="false">
        <cfargument name="member" required="true">
        <cfargument name="payment" required="true">
        <cfset var memberId = variables.memberGateway.createMember(member.firstName(), member.lastName(), member.email())>
        <cfset member.setMemberId(memberId)>
        <cfset variables.paymentService.processPayment(member,payment)>
        <cfset variables.notificationService.sendWelcomeMessage(member)>
    </cffunction>

</cfcomponent>
{% endhighlight %}











<p>
	In this example the MemberService object is initialised with each of objects required to perform it's work. 
	The technique of organising objects in this way is known as dependency injection.
</p>

<p>
	The function to notice here is the <b>newMember()</b> function which is the primary purpose of the Facade. 
	This function is very easy to use and simply takes a member object (containing new member details) 
	and a payment object (containing membership payment details, such as a credit card number and an amount) 
	then performs the steps required  to register a new member:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the member account,</li>
<li>Process the payment, then</li>
<li>Send a welcome email</li>
</ol>

<p>
	This is only a very simple example of membership account creation. In real world applications this process 
	is likely to be more sophisticated. However, it is likely that you would be able to create a MemberService 
	Facade that is as simple as presented here.  
</p>



<h2>Simplify the usage of a complex object</h2>

<p>
	The goal of a Facade is to simply make existing code easier to use, so it may only represent a front for 
	one or two other objects, rather than a large number of objects. 
	For example, suppose you have a very complicated/messy/undocumented or otherwise hard to understand object. 
	You can create a Facade object to simplify the usage of the complex object in some situations.
</p>

<p>

</p>



<h2>Accessing objects beyond the Facade</h2>

<p>
	A Facade is intended to provide a simplified interface to a more complex system, 
	but a Facade is not intended to prevent you from accessing that system if required. 
	So if you need more functionality than the Facade can provide then you can directly use the underlying objects.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Subsystem access UML diagram' src='assets/images/77188C809A4CBC6225E1A2292534F347.png' />
</p>

<p>
	For example, our Technology Room Facade above only provides a facility to turn everything on or turn everything off. 
	Once you have turned everything on then you will need access to some of the underlying objects in order to teach the class. 
	For example, you may not need to use the audio system, or you may need to adjust the projector's focus, etc.
</p>


<h2>Creating multiple Facades</h2>

<p>
	If you have a large complex system, you may benefit from creating more than one Facade 
	that accesses the same underlying system. Each Facade would provide a different kind of 
	simplified view of the underlying system.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt='Multiple Facade UML diagram' src='assets/images/07FA9CABE20C4E4A2FD711E38DA57AF1.png' />
</p>



<h2>Avoid adding features to your Facades</h2>

<p>
	When you have a Facade it can be a very convenient place to add additional business logic 
	on top of what the underlying more complex system provides. For very simple things this may 
	be fine but if the business logic is more sophisticated then it should be moved into the 
	underlying system instead. Your Facade is intended to simplify the underlying system rather 
	than enhance it. It also means that if you introduce a different Facade in the future for the 
	same subsystem then it would not have access to those new features. 
</p>

<p>
	This does not mean, however, that your Facade should just forward requests onto the underlying system. 
	It does know how to coordinate the underlying objects to produce a useful result, 
	but it generally does not add any new features. 
</p>



<h2>The subsystem should avoid calling the Facade</h2>

<p>
	A Facade knows the details of how to use the underlying subsystem, but the subsystem 
	should not know about the Facade; the relationship should be a <i>unidirectional</i> one.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the following diagram illustrates a bidirectional relationship between the 
	Facade and its subsystem which should be avoided:
</p>

</p>

<p>
	By removing the relationship from the underlying objects to the Facade we have improved our design:

<h2>Some notes about Session Facades</h2>

<p>
	A Session Facade is a name commonly used within the CFML community to represent an object 
	that provides access a user's &quot;session&quot; data. In a trivial implementation, 
	this is simply an object with get() and set() functions that access the session scope.
</p>

<p>
	There are a couple of points to consider when using this kind of object:
</p>

<h3>Approaches to using a Session Facade</h3>

<p>
	Firstly, replacing all occurrences of session.someVariable with 
	sessionFacade.get(&quot;someVariable&quot;) throughout your application may provide a degree of usefulness, 
	such as allowing you to change how session data is managed, but generally provides little benefit over 
	accessing the session directly. A better approach considers that session data is typically associated 
	with an individual user. Knowing this it is often a better design to create a User object and store that 
	within the session which then provides you with all of the data relevant to the user.
</p>

<h3>Session Facade terminology</h3>

<p>
	The idea behind a Facade is to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>provide an object that simplifies the usage of a more complex underlying system, and</li>
<li>allow you to access the underlying system if required.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	The Session Facade we have described here is essentially a simple wrapper around the 
	session scope that should be used for all session scope access. We can see that our 
	Session Facade is not strictly a Facade because it does not really simplify session 
	usage and is not designed to be bypassed. It is used to encapsulate the session scope 
	entirely. So what pattern it is? Accessing our session in this way is perhaps closer 
	to a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/gateway.html">Gateway</a>, 
	which is a pattern that encapsulates access to an external resource and makes it look 
	like a regular object. 
</p>

<h3>Session Facades in Java</h3>

<p>
	Lastly, it is also worth noting that a Session Facade is formal design pattern from the 
	<a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/corej2eepatterns/Patterns/SessionFacade.html">Java J2EE design catalogue</a>. 
	It is a pattern specific to implementing a Java application using &quot;Enterprise Java Beans&quot; 
	and is in no way related to sessions as we use them within CFML. 
	So if you are speaking to a Java developer then the term &quot;Session Facade&quot; 
	will have a very different meaning.
